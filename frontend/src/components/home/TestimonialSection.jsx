    I applied to OSC at the end of my first year, thinking there is no way I am capable of getting into this club. But miraculously, I got in for the interview and furthermore was elected as the secretary for the club.
    Then, the club became very close to me, and I used to love being a part of it. There were although ups and downs, with a lot of events, things not going as we wanted to be, but everything used to end in our favour.
    
    So, yeah it was pretty much it, 4 semester, 2 years of a roller coaster ride at OSC ðŸ˜‚`,

    what a wild ride! From the moment I jumped in,
    it was like crashing a tech carnival where rules are just suggestions.
    Code flowing like good vibes, and the camaraderie?
    We flipped off limitations, embraced collaboration like it's the new cool, and yeah,
    we've had our share of legendary bug hunts â€“ those were the real treasure hunts.
    Whether it's wrangling lines of code or cracking jokes,
    OSC isn't just about software, it's a damn mindset.
    Here's to the rebels crafting tomorrow's tech with
    a friendly 'fuck you' to the norm!`,

    From my Bengali roots to my ECE background,
    I've brought a fusion of creativity and tech. My design game? On point.
    I've spun out concepts crazier than a rollercoaster, and yeah,
    some left even me scratching my head. Hyper-active? Guilty as charged,
    but that's what fuels my brainstorming sessions.
    The community's like a canvas where my ideas paint the future.
    Sure, I get lost in the chaos, but that's where the magic happens.
    OSC's my playground, where confusion meets innovation!`,
